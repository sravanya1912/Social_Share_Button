# Security Policy

This policy applies only to the SocialShareButton repository.

## Supported Versions

| Version / Branch | Supported |
| ---------------- | --------- |
| `main`           | ✅ Yes    |
| Other branches   | ❌ No     |

Older versions may not receive security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately using GitHub’s built-in private vulnerability reporting feature:

https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/SocialShareButton/security/advisories/new

Private reporting ensures the issue can be addressed responsibly without exposing users to unnecessary risk.

+**Note:** If the link above does not work, private vulnerability reporting may not yet be enabled for this repository. A repository administrator can enable it by following the [GitHub Docs guide for configuring private vulnerability reporting for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/configuring-private-vulnerability-reporting-for-a-repository).

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate efficiently, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact and affected components
- Any proof-of-concept code, logs, or screenshots (if applicable)
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

Providing detailed information helps us respond more quickly and effectively.

## Response and Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability report is received:

We will acknowledge receipt of the report, investigate and validate the issue, and work on a fix if the vulnerability is confirmed. We will coordinate responsible disclosure with the reporter before any public announcement.

We kindly ask reporters to avoid public disclosure until a fix has been released, allowing us to protect users effectively.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and thank you for helping keep SocialShareButton secure and reliable.
