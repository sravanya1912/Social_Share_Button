# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, the latest version available on the `main` branch is actively maintained.  
Security updates will be applied to the latest stable version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, report it privately using GitHub’s built-in private vulnerability reporting feature:
https://github.com/AOSSIE-Org/SocialShareButton/security/advisories/new

This ensures the issue can be addressed responsibly and without exposing users to risk.

You may also contact the maintainers directly if necessary.

## What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate efficiently, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact
- Any proof-of-concept or screenshots (if applicable)
- Suggested mitigation or fix (if known)

## Response Process

Once a vulnerability report is received:

1. The maintainers will acknowledge the report.
2. The issue will be investigated.
3. A fix will be developed and tested.
4. A security update will be released if necessary.
5. Proper credit will be given for responsible disclosure (if desired).

Thank you for helping keep SocialShareButton secure and reliable.
